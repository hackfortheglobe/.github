# First event: HACK FOR SRI LANKA

Our first target is Sri Lanka. The country is in the midst of a massive humanitarian crisis, which involves food shortages and power cuts of at least 10 hours per day. The people lack easy access to essential information such as the times and locations of power cuts that could help them make better decisions. 

To address these challenges, we have succesfully organized a 24h Hackathon on Friday April 8th 2022 at Stanford University (Palo Alto, CA). [More info here](https://change-via-data.wixsite.com/hack-for-the-globe/events)
