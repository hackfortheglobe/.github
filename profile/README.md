# First event: HACK FOR SRI LANKA

Our first project is Sri Lanka. The country is in the midst of a massive humanitarian crisis, which involves food shortages and power cuts of at least 10 hours per day. The people lack easy access to essential information such as the times and locations of power cuts that could help them make better decisions. 
To address these challenges, we are organizing a 24h Hackathon:

- When: **Friday April 8th**
- Where: **Stanford University**, Palo Alto, CA
